    <p>For my idea, I want to make a website for people in Detroit that have been unseen that are good at art, architecture, or sculptures and they can showcase their art by sending it through the format of the website I made so it can be seen by everyone around the world.
        This website accepts digital or physical art and it can be turned in by submitting it inside the website for showcasing.
        The problem and goal that this is solving is to make artists that haven't got a chance to express their art and have an opportunity for a better job in the future to start showcasing and publishing all types of architecture for the world to see and give their thoughts and expressions.
    </p>
    <p>The point of the website is to showcase the art and have people submit the art inside the website by 
        signing up and having at least a between 5 - 12 months of completing their project art.
         Once the art is done they can submit it and it will be showcased all over the website for people to see.</p>
         
 <p>Art can also be used for culture as well and it could be from different
      parts of the world and considered to be used for inspiration for young artist getting started. These projects need to be innovative and different in there own way to show different characteristics from different artist.
    These projects need to be creative
     as well if its painting or sculpting,
    </p>

    <p>The website also allows people between age 14 and up to present there art and it will also be good 
        for kids cause they have a good opportunity for better jobs doing what 
        they like in the future and how they want to do it.
    </p>
    <p>The impact that this is gonna do is to help artists present there skill of designing art or there 
        skill of architecture and also use this skill for jobs in the future and get paid for it.
        The usability of the website is to be used as 
        showcasing and progress showing so we know when your working on there project and if they need any help if they are stuck.
        </p>
        
        <p>The flow of the website is also to reach out to people in need of help and also used to give out help also if they need it, after 5 months are passed projects are accepted past that point for example june from january projects are accepted past the point.
            The technical prowess is that projects should 
            scale from when you started to when its in the middle of being designed and also for when it will be finished.
            And finally the scalability be should good 
            due to how long the projects was worked on and when it will be finished.
            </p>
