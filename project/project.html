    <p>For my idea, I want to make a website for people in Detroit that have been unseen that are good at art, architecture, or sculptures and they can showcase their art by sending it through the format of the website i made so it can be seen by everyone around the world.
        This website accepts digital or physical art and it can be turned in by submitting it inside the website for showcasing.
        The problem and goal that this is solving is to make artists that haven't got a chance to express their art and have an opportunity for a better job in the future to start showcasing and publishing all types of architecture for the world to see and give their thoughts and expressions.
    </p>
    <p>The point of the website is to showcase the art and have people submit the art inside the website by signing up and having at least a between 5 - 12 months of completing their project art. Once the art is done they can submit it and it will be showcased all over the website for people to see.
